**Model Training & Coefficient Interpretation Workflow**
An interactive Streamlit app that walks through a 14â€‘step machine learning workflow â€” from raw data exploration to model training, coefficient interpretation, stability checks, and final validation. 
Inspired by Scikitâ€‘learnâ€™s coefficient interpretation guide https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/inspection/plot_linear_model_coefficient_interpretation.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-inspection-plot-linear-model-coefficient-interpretation-py

**Features**
Stepâ€‘byâ€‘step workflow (0 â†’ 14) covering:
Data upload & exploration (numerical + categorical features)
Model training & prediction error analysis
Coefficient inspection, scaling, and normalization
Crossâ€‘validation for stability checks
Collinearity diagnostics (AGE vs EXPERIENCE)
Featureâ€‘drop experiments to test robustness
Final performance evaluation (MedAE, RÂ², error plots)
Interactive visualizations for every stage
Transparent & reproducible process for stakeholders and evaluators

**Workflow Phases**
Phase 1 â€” Data & Exploration (Stepsâ€¯0â€“4): Upload data, explore numerical & categorical features, visualize relationships.
Phase 2 â€” Training & Interpretation (Stepsâ€¯5â€“10): Train model, evaluate errors, inspect coefficients, scale & normalize.
Phase 3 â€” Stability & Validation (Stepsâ€¯11â€“14): Crossâ€‘validation, collinearity checks, featureâ€‘drop experiments, final performance.

Key Learnings
Scaling coefficients is essential for fair comparison
Correlated features destabilize models (AGE vs EXPERIENCE)
Crossâ€‘validation reveals coefficient robustness
Ridge regularization improves stability without losing accuracy
Coefficients â‰  causality â€” interpret with caution
